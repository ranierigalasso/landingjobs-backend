# Express Server API

This is a simple API for educational purposes

## Install and Configuration

Before start you need to rename `.env.sample` to `.env` and modify the env variable called `DATABASE` with your database url.

```
NODE_ENV=development
DATABASE=mongodb://localhost:27017/<DBname>
```

In terminal run `npm install` in order to install all the dependencies. Once all the dependencies are installed type `npm start`.

Now you server is running in `http://localhost:5000`.

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
